# json-schema-typescript

Generate typescript interfaces and deserializer logic from a JSON schema

Features

- Generate named interfaces and enums for to the root of the schema ane each definition in the top-level "$defs" property
- Generate inline interfaces and enums for each property that doesn't have an explicit definition in "$defs"
- Handle references to external schemas by importing using the relative path
- JSON deserializer that uses autogenerated type information.

Assumptions:

- All definitions are in the top-level "$defs" property
- External schema references use relative paths
- The name of the schema file is used as the root type name of the schema

Note:
- Features in JSON schema which result in ambiguous during deserialization are not supported.

## Implementation Notes

- The JSON schema is first converted to an intermediate representation that drives the generator the generate the top-level types and also the type information used by the JSON deserializer.
